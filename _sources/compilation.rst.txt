Compilation
=======================

* **Input:** Code.
* **Options:** ...
* **Output:** Executable code.
* **Script for executing stage:** main_compile



Compilation is done by CompileInstance objects each having a CodeType and a Compiler attribute that contain information like file paths and flags that are needed for compilation.

To use additional compilers or code types add corresponding classes / subclasses and if neccessary extend the implementation of CompileInstance for additional functionalities.
