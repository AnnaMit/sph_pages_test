These instructions will guide you through the different stages of the program and show you
how to fit your own data into the program, so that your ODE will be integrated correctly.
The first thing you should do is open a command shell and move into the program repository
``tidowa``.

Before every new use of the Program use the ``make clean`` command to clean all discretized
records and generated code.

2.1. Stage 1: Discretization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Writing an ODE record
......................

To use the program for your own ODE system, navigate to the ``data/disc/`` directory
and edit the file ``configuration_template.py``. In this file you will probably find the implementation of the previously used ODE. Fill the variables in this file with your specific data in the
following way:

Make sure to import the ``sympy`` library at the start of your file::

   import sympy as sp

Then specify your ode system using the following directives:

parameternames
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is a string with all parameters appearing in your ODE, seperated
by whitespaces. Be sure to also declare these parameters seperated by commas on the left side.

*Example:*
An ODE with two parameter ``lambda1`` and ``lambda2`` needs a config containing::

   parameternames = 'lambda1 lambda2'
   lambda1, lambda2 = sp.symbols(parameternames)

variablenames
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Similar to parameternames, this is a string with all variables appearing in
your ODE, seperated by whitespaces. Be sure to also declare these variables seperated by com-mas on the left side of the next line.

*Example:* An ODE with two variables ``u`` and ``v`` needs a config containing::

   variablenames = 'u v'
   u, v = sp.symbols(variablenames, cls=sp.Function)

ode
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is a tuple of sympy Equality-Objects, which are created by calling Eq() with the right
functionparameter. The Equality class is initialized with two functionparameter called lhs and
rhs. An object Eq(lhs, rhs) symbolizes a mathematical equation of form ``lhs = rhs``. Make sure
to only use parameter that you defined before. Make sure to write every variable depending on
``t`` (i.e. v(t)). Make sure you only use arithmetic operators, not sympy classes. Make sure to
only enter equations of the form:

.. math:: y'(t) = f (t, y(t))

First order derivatives are symbolized with sympy in the form ``y(t).diff(t)``

*Example:* An ODE with the parameter and variables of the two examples above and the two
equations:

.. math:: u'(t) = −\lambda_1 \cdot v(t)
.. math:: v'(t) = \lambda_2 \cdot u(t) + 1

Then the config to this ODE should be containing::

   ode = (
   sp.Eq(u(t).diff(t), -lambda1*v(t)),
   sp.Eq(v(t).diff(t), lambda2*u(t) + 1),
   )

Equations can be built using standard mathematical opererators like ``+, -, *, **, /, exp(), <, =`` that correspond to the same semantics as in Python and sympy operators

.. todo::
   link /explain sympy


methods
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is a tuple containing the methods used for integrating each single equation in
the ODE. The methods are defined as a string and the indexing of these variables corresponds
to the indexing of the equations in the ode-variable. The currently implemented integration
methods are: ``ExplicitEuler``, ``RungeKutta1`` (Explicit Euler), ``RungeKutta2`` (Midpoint),
``RungeKutta4`` (RK4), ``Heun`` and ``Midpoint`` .

*Example:* If the first equation of the ODE from the examples above should be integrated with
the explicit Euler method and the second with a 4th order Runge-Kutta, then this needs a
config containing::

   methods = (
   'ExplicitEuler',
   'RungeKutta',
   )

If you want to use the Operator Splitting techniques make sure you write the splitting method
you want to use first and then the two methods you want to integrate the split up terms
with, each seperated by whitespaces. The Operator splitting does only work if you have an
addition as the mathematically last evaluated operation. The operator splitting will split the
term on the left most addend and the rest of the addends. It is not possible to use an operator
splitting technique recursively (i.e. ``OrdinarySplitting ExplicitEuler OrdinarySplitting ExplicitEuler ExplicitEuler``).
*Example:* For the ODE of the examples above::

   methods = (
   'Midpoint',
   'StrangSplitting ExplicitEuler ExplicitEuler',
   )


Also make sure, that any sympy class, i.e. Symbol or Eq, called in your config is referenced
with the correct prefix, as in the case of the examples sp.

Example Configurations
......................

An example for a complete configuration file is the following:


.. literalinclude:: ../../data/disc/example_configurations/oscillating/config_osc_opsplit.py
    :language: python


You can also find pre-implemented config-files, stored in the ``data/disc/example_configurations/``
directory and load them with the following command::

   $ make load_config filepath=relative/path/to/file

Running the Discretization Stage
......................................

The discretization stage will produce a record in the directory ``data/codegen/discrete_records/``.
The next stage (code-generation) will use the record in here called ``record_1.py``. If there are
any records in here from previous program runs, which you don’t need anymore be sure to call::

   $ make clean_records

If you are pleased with your ``config_template.py`` you can complete the discretization stage by calling::

   $ make discretize

This command will run the file ``main_disc.py`` which is responsible for everything, that happens in the discretization stage.


If you have hit the ``make discretize`` command and no error occured, the discretization stage is completed and there should be a new record (i.e. ``record_1.py``) in the directory ``data/disc/discrete_records``. This new file contains the discretized version of your ODE, as well
as some variable declarations.

2.2. Stage 2: Code-Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After completing the discretization stage, there should be a new record in the directory ``data/disc/discretized_records``. These records yield all the information needed to start the Code-
Generator. Make sure, that the record you want to generate code for is called ``record_1.py``, as
only the record with this name will be used by the Code-Generator.

If you are sure, that the record is named correctly you can start the Code-Generator using
the following command::

   $ make generate

.. todo::
   which generators are there?
   change file names / directories cause languages are there?


If you have hit the ``make generate`` command and no error occured, there should be a new
C-file in the directory ``src/exec/ccode/``, named ``calc_func.c``. This file implements the calculation of the values of all variables in your ODE.

Specify Initial Values and Parameter Values
...............................................
At this point, you should input a CSV-file into the program, containing the initialvalues, as
well as the values of the parameter, specified in the ``config_template.py``. The exact format of
each line in this CSV-file is as follows::

   <variablevalue1> <variablevalue2> ... ; <parametervalue1> <parametervalue2> ...

*Example:* An examplary line of the input CSV-file for the example of the discretization stage
could be as follows::

   1 2 ; -1 1

This would mean, that ``u`` has an initialvalue of 1, ``v`` has an initialvalue of 2, ``lambda1`` has
a value of -1 and ``lambda2`` has a value of 1, assuming the exemplary ``config_template.py``
from the last section. Make sure, that the order of the values of the variables and parameter
here, corresponds to the order of the variables and parameter in the ``config_template.py`` respectively.
If you are done creating this input CSV-file, place it in the folder ``data/exec/input/`` and
call it ``input.csv``. The program will later search for a file named ``input.csv`` and load its content line by line. You can also use already implemented input CSV-files (There exists one for
each example config) by loading them from the ``tests/test_input/`` directory, with the following command::

   $ make load_input filepath=path/to/input/csv/file

*Example for the ODE of all previous examples in this file*::

   $ make load_input filepath=tests/test_input/test_input_osc.csv

2.3. Stage 3: Compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This stage mostly consists of the ``make`` commands, as it exists for compiling and executing
the program. If you have completed the first two stages, there should now exist a file, containing
the Code to calculate all variable values (i.e. ``calc_func.c``).


2.3. Stage 4: Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This stage mostly consists of the ``make`` commands, as it exists for compiling and executing
the program. If you have completed the first two stages, there should now exist a file, containing
the Code to calculate all variable values (i.e. ``calc_func.c``).

To complete the execution stage type the following command::

   $ make C filepath=path/to/input/csv/file

There aremultiple languages here to choose from, but for now we
concentrate on C. The program will now first compile all C files necessary for the calculations,
using the ``gcc`` Compiler. This will create an executable called ``c_main_exec`` in the ``build/``
directory.

After the compilation the executable will be automatically run taking the CSV-file specified
after ``filepath`` as command line argument. If you did not specify the ``filepath`` option (i.e.
``make C``), the program will take the file named ``input.csv`` in the ``data/exec/input/`` directory.
If you do not delete the ``c_main_exec`` file, the next call of ``make C`` will skip compiling the
code again and directly run the executable.
The execution of the program will create a number of files equal to the number of lines in
your input CSV-file. Each of these files contains lines with the chronologically ordered time -
variablevalues pairs in CSV-format. The numbering of these files corresponds to the index of
the line (starting with 0) in the input CSV-file, which has created this output. In Example the
third line of an input CSV-file will create a data output file called ``2_data.csv``.

2.4 Stage 5: Plotting
.....................................................
Finally you can plot the output data using the following command::

   $ make plot filepath=path/to/output/data against=yes/no var=variablelist

If filepath is left empty the plotter will use the file called ``0_data.csv`` in the ``data/exec/output/``
directory. The ``var`` option can be used to specify, which variables to plot. Define them as a
string, with each variable seperated by a whitespace. For Example if you want to plot the variables ``u`` and ``v`` then use the command::

   make plot var=``u v``

The plotter will then plot each of these variables against the time (t) in a seperate window. If
the ``var`` option is not specified all variables will be plotted against time.
You can also use the ``against`` option if you want to specify two variables against each other
and not against time. To do this use ``against=yes`` and specify exactly two variables in the
``var`` option. For example if you want to plot ``u`` against ``v`` use the command::
   $ make plot against=yes var=``u v``


.. todo::
   add my new plot method

The ``against`` option is set to ``no`` by default.
To clean up for the next use of the program you can use the clean commands in the make
file. For example ``make clean`` cleans up any records from the discretization stage, code produced in the code generation stage, and output and executables generated in the execution stage.

3. Example of a full program use cycle
------------------------------------------------

.. todo::
   make bash

The following bashcode describes a full exemplary use cycle of the program::

   $ make clean
   $ make load_config filepath=oscillating/config_osc.py
   $ make load_input filepath=tests/test_input/test_input_osc.csv
   $ make discretize
   $ make generate
   $ make C
   $ make plot against=yes var=``u v``
